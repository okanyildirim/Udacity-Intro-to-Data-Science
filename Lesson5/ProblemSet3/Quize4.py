1-YES

2-Non-parametric statistical methods are used when numerical data do not have normal distribution.
The Mann Whitney u test is an alternative nonparametric test I applied in this question.
I obtained that p value is less than  .05 critical value.
Therefore, there is meaningful differecies between rainy and non rainy days.
I calculate the mean of entries with rain and the mean of entries without rain.
Then I apply the Mann-Whitney U-statistic by utulizing scipy lib.
